# Changelog

All notable changes to **kit4go** are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

kit4go is a **multi-module** repository. Each version tag below covers the root
module and all sub-modules; sub-modules carry matching per-module tags
(e.g. `log4go/v0.3.0` alongside `v0.3.0`).

## [Unreleased]

Deep quality-hardening pass: 30+-round autonomous audit (scenario, invariant,
memory-model, wrapper, network, lifecycle lenses) over every package + all 18
sub-modules. Real bugs fixed; E10 fuzz coverage + H6 godoc examples expanded;
contract gaps documented.

### Fixed

- **adaptive** — Submit/Close race: a job accepted (Submit returned nil) could be
  stranded after Close's final drain (no worker drained it). RWMutex mirroring
  batcher's Add-vs-Close pattern.
- **kafka** — partition-consumer channel-mode Messages() never closed on Close
  (both sarama + franz-go). Caller `for range Messages()` blocked forever →
  goroutine leak + shutdown hang. Pump closes output on exit; sarama pump uses a
  cancellable context so Close interrupts a blocked send.
- **httpclient** — non-idempotent POST/PATCH retried on io.EOF/
  io.ErrUnexpectedEOF (request sent + processed, response lost), bypassing the
  idempotency guard → double-charge. Added sentButNoResponse check; pre-send
  dial errors stay retryable.
- **log4go** — FileWriter.Stop double-close race: concurrent Stop (user Stop
  racing Logger.Close) both closed w.stop → panic. Guarded with
  closing.CompareAndSwap (matching Kafka/Net).
- **ip** — TypeFlagIsLinkLocalMulticast filter was dead (copy-paste). IsPublic
  classified 0.0.0.0/::/broadcast as public. NumberToIP dropped sign on
  negative + truncated over-width IPv4. MaskIPToCIDR accepted non-canonical
  masks.
- **money** — Div(MinInt64,-1) overflow (SIGFPE amd64, wrap arm64); reachable
  via arithmetic. Parse double-sign ("+-0.05" → +0.05). Scale float64 drift
  above 2^53 → ErrOverflow guard.
- **decimal** — Parse double-sign ("--5" → +5.00).
- **otp** — VerifySecret rejected lowercase base32 that generators accept.
- **file** — CopyFile(src,src) destroyed the source (O_TRUNC before read).
- **hotkey** — per-key []time.Time unbounded; opt-in WithMaxHitsPerKey (D5).
- **breaker** — half-open epoch-bleed: a probe admitted in one half-open epoch
  that outlasted a trip+cooldown credited/tripped the next epoch's counters
  (premature close / spurious re-trip). Fixed via a generation counter
  (halfOpenGen) incremented on each Open→HalfOpen transition; recordSuccess/
  Failure credit/trip only if the probe's captured epoch matches the current.

### Added

- E10 fuzz targets: bloom (no-false-negative), countmin (never-under-count), str
  (CamelToSnake determinism), topk (TouchN heavy-hitter), datetime
  (DeltaDateDays round-trip), trie (Insert/Get round-trip), ip (MaskIPToCIDR
  canonical round-trip).
- Godoc examples: rate, tracing, email, grpcserver.

### Changed

- aerospike Close guarded with sync.Once (template consistency).

### Documented (no behavior change)

- Contract clarifications: fanout.PublishBlocking, batcher.Close, breaker
  epoch-bleed, topk TouchN starvation, freqcap evictIdleLocked O(maxKeys),
  datetime UnixToDuration raw-ns-cast, adaptive monitor-blocks-Close, log4go
  daemon-panic-OverflowBlock, json jsoniter-cycle + sonic-amd64, bit Min/Max
  overflow, health Check-panic→500, uuid README v1→v5, trie /-trim
  normalization.

## [0.8.0] — 2026-07-12

Breaking: gofrs/uuid v1 → v5 + full dependency currency upgrade across all 18
sub-modules. No wrapper code changes beyond the uuid import-path migration.

### Changed

- **BREAKING** — gofrs/uuid `v1.2.0` → `v5.4.0` (semantic import versioning).
  The import path changes from `github.com/gofrs/uuid` to
  `github.com/gofrs/uuid/v5`. `NewV1`/`NewV4` now wrap `uid.Must()` (v5
  returns `(UUID, error)`; `Must` preserves the existing no-error API, panicking
  on CSPRNG failure — the same observable behavior as v1 where these could not
  fail). `Equal` uses `==` (v5 removed `uid.Equal`; `UUID` is comparable).
- **BREAKING** — `uuid.NewV2` removed (gofrs dropped DCE Security V2 in v4+;
  no kit4go callers used it).
- All 18 sub-module client libraries upgraded to latest via `go get -u`
  (minio-go, mongo-driver, aerospike-client-go, go-elasticsearch,
  clickhouse-go, pgx, go-redis, sarama/franz-go, grpc, prometheus, etc.).
  All build/vet/test-race clean; no wrapper interface assertions broke.
- Root minor dependency bumps: `golang.org/x/net` 0.57, `x/sys` 0.47,
  `x/text` 0.40, `x/arch` 0.29, `stretchr/objx` 0.5.3.

## [0.7.1] — 2026-07-11

Security and dependency-currency patch. No API changes.

### Security

- Bumped the `go` directive 1.26.2 → **1.26.5** across `go.work` + root + all 18
  sub-modules. go1.26.2's standard library carried six reachable CVEs
  (crypto/tls GO-2026-5856, net/http GO-2026-4918, crypto/x509 GO-2026-5037,
  net GO-2026-4971, net/textproto GO-2026-5039, mime GO-2026-5038) — the root
  cause of the Dependabot alerts. go1.26.5 fixes all six; `govulncheck` now
  reports 0 affected (was 5–6 per module). Consumers and CI
  (`setup-go` `go-version-file: go.mod`) build with the patched toolchain.

### Changed

- Root module minor dependency bumps for currency: `golang.org/x/net` 0.56→0.57,
  `x/sys` 0.46→0.47, `x/text` 0.38→0.40, `x/arch` 0.28→0.29,
  `stretchr/objx` 0.5.2→0.5.3. `gofrs/uuid` pinned at v1.2.0 (v4 removes
  `NewV2` and changes `NewV1`/`NewV4` to return `(UUID, error)` — a breaking
  jump deferred to a future minor). Sub-modules unchanged (no patch upgrades
  available; already current).

## [0.7.0] — 2026-07-11

A quality-hardening release: a multi-round, repo-wide audit (every package
audited, all fuzz targets run) found and fixed real defects that green CI and
100% coverage missed — concentrated in concurrency, float-drift edge cases, and
the callback-panic-recovery gap. No new packages; a few additive observability
methods. All hot paths remain 0-alloc (verified by `-benchmem`).

### Fixed

- **fsm**: `Send` released the data lock to run the action (so the action could
  call back into the machine), but a second concurrent `Send` could then observe
  the same source state, run its own action, and both transitions committed (last
  writer clobbered). For side-effecting actions (a concurrent pay+cancel) both
  effects ran yet only one state stuck. A dedicated `sendMu` now serializes
  `Send` across its full duration while the data lock is still released during
  the action (callbacks `Current/Is/Can` do not deadlock).
- **limiter**: `Wait` checked `closed` only at entry, so a `Close` issued while a
  call was already blocked at capacity left it polling until the context expired.
  All five algorithms re-check `closed` each poll iteration (the contract).
- **hotreload / adaptive / kafka(franz-go)**: library-owned goroutines ran user
  callbacks (`Loader`, `work`, the consumer handler) with no recover — a single
  panicking callback crashed the host. Recovered + counted (`Recovered()`) +
  surfaced via `SetOnPanic` (mirrors the existing workerpool/batcher convention);
  the franz-go backend now matches sarama (which already recovered), so the
  seamless-switch contract holds and `ConsumerMetrics.Recovered` is no longer
  structurally always 0 under franz-go.
- **money**: `mulChecked(math.MinInt64, -1)` panicked instead of returning
  `ErrOverflow` — `MinInt64 / -1` is the one integer division Go aborts at
  runtime, hit inside the overflow check.
- **shortlink**: `encodeBaseN` used a 12-byte buffer sized only for base62; a
  2-char alphabet (the API allows `len > 1`) needs up to 64 digits for
  `MaxUint64`, so `IDShortener` with a small alphabet panicked on
  index-out-of-range past ~4096 or on `Encode(MaxUint64)`.
- **random**: `RandStringWithKind` mapped the lowest set bit to the highest index,
  scrambling the character groups whenever the kind bits were not contiguous —
  `kind=5` (digits+lowercase) produced lowercase+uppercase.
- **datetime**: `DeltaDateDays` diffed local midnights and divided by 24h, so a
  DST spring-forward day (23h) made consecutive dates across it count as 0.
  Each date is re-expressed as UTC midnight before the diff (UTC has no DST).
- **budget**: the normalized weight curve drifted above 1.0 on a trailing-zero
  weight (the pinned endpoint then sat below an interior point — a non-monotonic
  planned-spend curve), and the TargetSpend interpolation fraction went a hair
  negative (negative target). Both clamped at the domain boundary.
- **hyperloglog**: the large-range correction used a 2^32 divisor (32-bit HLL
  paper) on a 64-bit-hash sketch — past ~2^32 distinct the term exceeded 1 and
  `math.Log(negative)` returned NaN. Now uses 2^64 (the actual hash space).
- **backpressure**: `Gate.max` was a plain int32 read by `TryAcquire` and written
  by `SetMax` (documented hot-reload) — a data race. Now `atomic.Int32`.

### Tests

- Six fuzz-harness assumption fixes (shortlink, cache, freqcap, backoff,
  featureflag) — each held a stronger/incorrect invariant than the package's
  documented contract, and the fuzzer's saved corpus had broken `go test`.
- Four new fuzz targets for previously-uncovered, non-trivial invariants:
  `latency` Quantile monotonicity, `retry` attempt-boundary, `reservoir`
  size/count, `consistenthash` GetN distinctness/top-1.
- `number` coverage 94% → 100% (`parseIntLossless` branches).

## [0.6.0] — 2026-07-08

### Added

- **elasticsearch** — search/analytics wrapper around the OFFICIAL
  `go-elasticsearch/v8` v8.19.6 (low-level esapi). Targets the maintained
  official client, replacing the semi-maintained `olivere/elastic` used by local
  projects. Document CRUD + search (Index/Get/Search/Delete); Bulk/Aggregation/
  Indices/Cat/Cluster via Client(). Handles two v8.19 API specifics: the ops are
  named-func-type FIELDS (held directly by the wrapper — no adapter layer), and
  option helpers are methods on those func types (`esapi.Index(nil).WithDocumentID`).
  Fail-fast Ping at construction; only transport errors count in Errors. The repo
  is now 18 sub-modules; the mainstream data/messaging/search stack is fully
  covered (relational → postgres; KV → redis/etcd/aerospike; document → mongo;
  columnar → clickhouse; object → minio; search → elasticsearch; messaging → kafka).

## [0.5.0] — 2026-07-08

Four new isolated sub-modules — the data-store / coordination client stack is now
comprehensive (relational → postgres; KV → redis/etcd/aerospike; document → mongo;
columnar → clickhouse; object → minio; messaging → kafka). Each is a thin
component wrapper (scope rule: wrap a client lib, no domain types) with functional
options, a fail-fast construction ping, a local-interface mock seam, atomic Metrics
+ SetOnEvent (zero-overhead when nil), an escape hatch to the underlying client,
and an env-gated integration test. All ≥96% coverage, -race + golangci-lint v2
clean. Scope is demand-driven from a scan of 109 local ad-tech/finance Go projects.

### Added

- **minio** — S3/MinIO object-store wrapper (`minio-go/v7` v7.2.1; speaks both
  backends). Put/Get/Stat/Remove/BucketExists/MakeBucket/ListObjects/PresignedGetObject.
  No Close (minio.Client is stateless HTTP).
- **etcd** — distributed-KV wrapper (`etcd client/v3` v3.6.13) for service
  registration (Put+Lease) and discovery (Get/Watch). KV/Lease/Watch scope (0/11
  local projects use Lock/Election — skipped).
- **mongo** — MongoDB document-store wrapper (`mongo-driver` v1.17.3). Two-type
  design (Client owns Connect/Ping/Disconnect + shared metrics; Collection wraps
  *mongo.Collection). Find/Insert/Update/Delete scope (CRUD; Count/Aggregate/
  BulkWrite via Collection()).
- **aerospike** — high-throughput KV wrapper (`aerospike-client-go/v8` v8.7.0).
  Put/Get/Delete/BatchGet. Wraps aerospike's `as.Error` (interface with unexported
  methods — mocked via a sentinel from a public aerospike function).

### Changed

- **go.work / Makefile / pr.yml / README** — wired all four new sub-modules into
  the workspace, per-module CI loops (build/vet/test/lint/coverage), and the
  sub-modules table. The repo is now 17 sub-modules + root.

## [0.4.0] — 2026-07-07

Build-out of the primitive library, a full-repo quality-review pass, a
coverage / benchmark / fuzz hardening sweep, a Go-modernization refactor, and
security/race closure. 30 commits since v0.3.0.

### Added

#### New primitive packages

- **errcode** — composable error-code registry with categories, wrapping, and
  HTTP/gRPC mapping helpers.
- **objpool** — generic `sync.Pool` wrappers with typed acquire/release and
  optional reset hooks.
- **priorityqueue** — generic heap-based priority queue (min/max, stable tie-break).
- **signalbus** — typed in-process signal/event bus with non-blocking dispatch.
- **hotreload** — file-watcher driven live reload of config/values with debounce
  and observable swap callbacks.
- **signing** — HMAC / RSA / Ed25519 sign + verify helpers with safe default
  encodings.
- **adaptive** — adaptive limiter / EWMA-style controllers that self-tune under
  observed load.

These seven packages round out the P1–P3 primitive tiers (errcode/objpool/
priorityqueue/signalbus as P1, hotreload/signing/adaptive as P2/P3).

#### CI

- **fuzz workflow** (`.github/workflows/fuzz.yml`) running the Go-native fuzz
  tests on a daily schedule across all packages.
- **bench workflow** (`.github/workflows/bench.yml`) with dynamic bench-package
  discovery (21 root + 3 sub-modules) and results artifact upload.

### Changed

- **datetime** (BREAKING in a v0.x sense): week first-day is now parameterized
  across the week/ISO-week helpers, and parse errors are surfaced instead of
  swallowed. Callers passing implicit locale defaults may need to supply the
  first-day argument explicitly.
- **uuid**: migrated from the deprecated satori/uuid to **gofrs/uuid**.
- **semaphore**: rewritten on channels for cleaner, race-free acquire/release.
- **limiter**: `NewLimiter` contract corrected — previously an unrecognized
  non-empty `Algorithm` silently fell back to token bucket (dead switch-default
  masking typos like `tokn_bucket`); now only an *empty* `Algorithm` defaults to
  token bucket and a non-empty unknown value returns `nil`. Godoc states the
  true contract.
- **modernization (Go 1.18+/1.22+)**: `interface{}` → `any` (174 sites / 37
  files); `for i := 0; i < N; i++` → `for i := range N` (40 sites); `sort.Slice`
  → `slices.SortFunc` with `cmp.Compare` in `file`, `topk`, `hotkey`.
- **godoc**: `revive` `exported` across all 14 modules — 22 genuine violations
  fixed (decimal/file/health/money/otp/random/topk/clickhouse/email/log4go);
  missing-godoc violations now **0**, including the 66 undocumented `log4go`
  exported symbols (`FileWriter` / `KafKaWriter` / `NetWriter` `.Write` recovered
  from a comment-block shadow).

### Fixed

Full-repo quality-review closure across the new packages and the wider
codebase, applied in two backlog batches plus targeted P0–P1 fixes:

- **P0 quality-review findings**: bounds/edge correctness in `file`, `number`,
  `topk`, `ip`, `otp` — incl. `topk` unbounded `counts` growth (now true O(K)),
  and `otp` CSPRNG-failure swallowed (`GenerateURLHOTP`/`GenerateURLTOTP` now
  return `error`, API-breaking v0.x, P0 on a secret).
- **P1 fixes**: `otp` error propagation, `str` unsafe-path migration, `health`
  docs; panic/bound fixes for `datetime.RangeTime`, `bit.Swap`, and a
  `hotreload` regression.
- **quality-review P0/P1** on the four P1 primitives
  (`errcode`/`signalbus`/`signing`/`adaptive`), and **P2/P3** polish on the new
  packages with README gap-fill.
- **batch1 backlog**: `random`, `hotkey`, `freqcap`, `featureflag`, `base62`,
  `errcode`, `ip`.
- **batch2 breaking backlog** (v0.x, behavior-changing): `maxprocs`, `bit`,
  `random`, `str`.
- **batch15**: `pkg:reason` error-prefix alignment (datetime/otp/log4go);
  compile-time interface assertions added to 9 packages
  (adaptive/cache/clickhouse/config/email/file/health/ip/shortlink).
- **batch19 R8**: `tcpclient.isClosedErr` now relies solely on
  `errors.Is(err, net.ErrClosed)` instead of `err.Error()` string-compare
  (not API-stable).

#### Security

- **signing**: parameter-injection — the canonical string joined values raw, so
  `{a:"1&b=2"}` collided with `{a:"1",b:"2"}`. Keys and values are now
  `url.QueryEscape`'d so `&`/`=` are unambiguous. Regression test
  `TestSign_NoParameterInjection`.
- **postgres**: DSN built via raw `fmt.Sprintf` misparsed passwords containing
  URL-special chars (`@:/#% ` space, common in RDS/Azure) to the wrong host.
  Now `url.PathEscape`'d on user + password; round-trip tests added.

#### Race conditions

- **number**: package-global `regForNumber` written by `SetRegForNumber`
  without sync while `Round*` read it — now `atomic.Pointer`; `-race` test.
- **ip**: `cacheLocalIP` fields read/written with no sync — torn read after TTL
  expiry; copy-on-write via `atomic.Pointer`; `-race` tests.
- **signalbus**: `invoke()` read the panic hook outside the lock while
  `SetPanicHook` wrote it; the hook is now snapshotted under the lock alongside
  the handlers. `-race` test `TestSetPanicHook_NoRaceWithPanickingHandler`.
- **log4go**: writer `onEvent` hook atomicized with `atomic.Pointer` so
  `SetOnEvent` is race-free against the daemon reader.
- **errcode**: `Is()` nil-deref panic on a typed-nil `*Error` target guarded;
  `errors.Is(err, (*Error)(nil))` returns false instead of panicking.

### Performance

- **bloom**: `sync.Pool` hot path → **0 allocs** on Add/Test.
- **consistenthash**: HRW `Get` allocated a per-node scratch `[]byte` — **500
  allocs/op at 500 nodes** on the per-request shard-routing primitive; stack/pool
  buffer → **4 allocs/op** (`GetN` 500 → 6). Identical hash output.
- **topk / hotkey**: `sort.Slice` → `slices.SortFunc` removes reflection from
  result sort (small hot-path win).
- **tcpclient**: dropped string-compare fast path for closed-conn detection.

### Tests / Quality

- **batch3a–batch3d coverage push** across all root packages and the seven
  sub-modules — `datetime`/`debounce`/`otp`/`shortlink` to 100%, `grpcclient`
  100%, kafka default backend 99.8% / franzgo 96%; documented unreachable
  branches in `budget`/`countmin`.
- **batch5 Go-native fuzz tests** for `signing`, `otp`, `hash`, `errcode`,
  `priorityqueue`, `shortlink`, `base62`.
- **batch6 benchmarks** — new `bench_test.go` for `bloom`, `topk`,
  `consistenthash`; verified `countmin`/`hyperloglog`/`loadbalance`/`auction`/
  `fsm`/`errcode`/`objpool`.
- **batch7 runnable godoc examples** for `number`, `xlo`, `json`, `backoff`,
  `health`, `datetime`, `hash`, `file`, `random`, `ip`.
- **batch8 coverage**: `shutdown`/`trie`/`udpclient` to 100%; documented
  unreachable paths in `tcpclient`/`freqcap`/`budget`.
- **batch9 sentinel align** — consistent test sentinel values across packages,
  refreshed `BENCHMARK.md`, new `CONTRIBUTING.md`, and fuzz expansion.
- **batch10/11 fuzz expansion** to 17 packages
  (`hotreload`/`adaptive`/`featureflag`/`fsm`/`auction`/`backoff`/`budget`/
  `freqcap`/`hotkey`/`loadbalance`/`lru`/`breaker`/`cache`/`money`/`limiter`/
  `ringbuffer`/`decimal`); additional `bench_test.go` for `lru`/`money`/`otp`/
  `reservoir`/`retry`/`ringbuffer`/`shortlink`/`signing`/`uuid`.
- **batch13 examples** for `trie`/`freqcap`/`budget`/`shutdown`/`fanout`/
  `batcher`/`metrics`; `BENCHMARK.md` corrected and CVE-clean deps confirmed
  (gofrs/uuid; satori purged).
- **flake hardening**: 3 tests that went red under `-race`/CI load fixed in
  production-correct code (`grpcserver` shutdown-timeout signals ready on
  genuine in-flight RPC; `batcher` pre-seeds an item so `flushedN>0` is
  guaranteed; `log4go` net/webhook poll instead of fixed deadlines).
- **cross-platform**: all 14 modules verified to compile on `linux/amd64` and
  `linux/arm64`.
- **CI**: added `clickhouse` to the module loop; fixed gofmt gate on
  `fuzz_test.go` files.

## [0.3.0] — 2026-07-05

The ClickHouse release plus a breaking `datetime` refinement, a quality-review
closure on the 7 packages introduced late in v0.2.0, and a coverage push to
≥95%. 21 commits since v0.2.0.

### Added

- **clickhouse** — thin wrapper module around `clickhouse-go/v2` (new
  sub-module; `clickhouse/v0.3.0`). Designed as a focused query/exec surface
  over the official driver rather than a re-imagined client.
- **featureflag**, **backpressure**, **middleware** — Tier-1 service primitives.
- **decimal**, **auction** — Tier-2 domain primitives (fixed-point decimal math;
  second-price / generalized auction utilities).
- **shortlink** — short-code generation + resolution helper.
- **fsm** — minimal deterministic finite-state machine.
- **Mermaid architecture diagram** added to the root README.
- Root README rewritten for v0.2.0/v0.3.0 (50+ packages, 11 sub-modules,
  quality story).

### Changed

- **Makefile** aligned with CI (11 sub-modules + golangci-lint v2).
- **datetime** (BREAKING in a v0.x sense): week first-day is now parameterized,
  and parse errors are surfaced instead of swallowed. Callers passing implicit
  locale defaults may need to supply the first-day argument explicitly.

### Fixed

- **quality-review fixes for 7 new packages** (10 issues), closing the audit
  opened against the late-v0.2.0 batch.
- **clickhouse** P2 polish from quality-review (F1/D9/I6/H3/H6).
- **redis**: `PoolStats` returned zero for every real client.
- **log4go**: atomicized writer `onEvent` hooks (L5/F2 race); replaced a
  hardcoded public broker IP with loopback (I7).
- **kafka + log4go**: exposed `CloseFlushTimeout`; documented the L6 composite
  bound.
- Injected a fake clock into `limiter`/`breaker`/`debounce`/`wtimer` to remove
  an E5 flaky-test class.
- `grpcserver` bumped `x/net` to v0.56.0 (dependabot #1).

### Tests / Quality

- Coverage raised to ≥95% across all packages, including mock-based coverage
  for `postgres`/`email`/`tracing` and boosts for `limiter`/`debounce`/
  `pipeline`/`grpcserver`/`httpserver`. README, `example_test`, and `bench_test`
  added for the 7 new packages.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-07-05

The concurrency + infrastructure release. Adds 18 new feature packages spanning
async/concurrency primitives, network-server wrappers, distributed-coordination
modules, and streaming/algorithm primitives, then closes a 6-round quality audit
across the whole repo. 63 commits since v0.1.0.

### Added

#### Concurrency & async primitives

- **batcher**, **fanout**, **pipeline**, **shutdown**, **workerpool**,
  **semaphore**, **debounce**, **wtimer**, **lru**, **retry**, **backoff**.
- **Library-owned workers recover panics** (callback-recover policy, adopted
  2026-07-05): `workerpool`, `pipeline`, `shutdown`, `wtimer`, and `debounce`
  recover job/callback panics and expose `Recovered()` / `SetOnPanic` hooks. The
  synchronous caller path is left raw.

#### Network-server wrappers

- **httpserver** — high-performance HTTP server + middleware + graceful shutdown.
- **grpcserver** — gRPC server with interceptors + graceful shutdown (new
  sub-module; `grpcserver/v0.2.0`).

#### Distributed-coordination modules

- **redis** — option-configured `go-redis/v9` wrapper (new sub-module).
- **redislock** — distributed lock on Redis (new sub-module).
- **rate** — distributed Redis rate limiter (GCRA) (new sub-module).
- Introduced a committed **`go.work`** so `go build`/`go test` resolve all
  sub-modules together.

#### Streaming & algorithm primitives

- **hyperloglog**, **countmin** — cardinality / frequency sketching (0-alloc
  hashing, hot-path benchmarks).
- **reservoir**, **topk** — reservoir sampling + top-K frequency tracking.
- **trie**, **ringbuffer**.
- **bloom**, **consistenthash**, **loadbalance**.
- **hash**, **idempotency**, **freqcap**, **hotkey**, **budget**, **cache**.

#### Infra wrapper modules

- **email** — go-mail SMTP wrapper (new sub-module).
- **metrics** — Prometheus wrapper (new sub-module).
- **tracing** — OpenTelemetry wrapper (new sub-module).
- **health** — liveness + readiness probes with dependency checks.

#### Utility

- **base62** — short-code codec; **random** gained a numeric verification-code
  helper. **money**, **config**, **limiter** (multi-algorithm: fixed-window /
  leaky / GCRA).

#### log4go & kafka enhancements

- **log4go**: batch daemon + kafka monitoring bridge + overflow constants +
  funnel docs; inline kafka circuit breaker with error-path spill (L4);
  observable daemon death + bounded shutdown (L5b + L6); counts recovered
  field-marshal panics (L5). Added `RESILIENCE.md`.
- **kafka**: configurable acks + `Snapshot`/`History`; franz-go `Close` flush;
  real-time memory monitoring (`BufferedBytes` + `Snapshot`) + batch metrics;
  `sarama` sync batch uses `SendMessages` (real batch); `franzProducer.Send`
  error path reports `bytesFailed`.

### Fixed

6-round full-repo quality audit (commits tagged `audit R1`–`R6`):

- **R1 / audit batch**: close-race data loss + start map race in `batcher`/
  `shutdown`; `fanout` `PublishBlocking`/`Close` deadlock; `pipeline` close
  deadlock + dropped submitter ctx; `workerpool` close/submit panic + results
  deadlock.
- **R2**: `lru`/`debounce` re-entrant deadlock + post-close / double-fire.
- **R3**: `udpclient`/`grpcclient` RNG race + retry-disable + replay-unsafe
  default; `httpclient` retry idempotency gating + RNG race.
- **R4**: `redislock` renewer ctx leak + spurious `onLost` + lost-close-on-panic.
- **R5**: `httpserver`/`grpcserver` shutdown fd leak + surfaced bind error.
- **R6**: `email`/`otp` secure TLS default + otp secret/period correctness.
- P0 quality-review findings in `random`/`money`/`trie`/`pipeline`.

### Changed

- **CI**: aligned Go version (1.26.2) and extended CI to all 11 sub-modules;
  aligned `go.work` directive with `go.mod` (1.26.0); skip timing-sensitive
  batch-vs-per-record test under `-short`.

### Tests / Quality

- Runnable godoc examples for 6 algorithm primitives and 5 pure-utility
  packages; hot-path benchmarks for `hyperloglog`/`countmin`.
- **quality rules**: published a package quality checklist (8 dimensions × 5
  roles), enhanced with industry standards (Uber/Google/K8s/OTel/golangci-lint),
  plus language-neutral rules + a Do-No-Harm dimension + simplicity ethos.
- **lint**: enabled the K2 high-signal `golangci-lint` v2 subset; trimmed the
  lint menu to match the codebase stance (K0); fixed 2 `errorlint` findings.
- Detailed concurrency-safety contracts documented for 10 packages.
- Package READMEs added for 17 previously-undocumented packages.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-06-28

Initial tagged release of the modernized multi-module kit4go. Establishes the
root module plus four standalone sub-modules, the high-performance `log4go`
logger, and the core utility surface. 61 commits.

### Added

#### Core utilities (root module)

- **bit**, **datetime**, **file**, **ip**, **json**, **number**, **otp** (TOTP
  / HOTP), **random**, **str**, **uuid** (requestID, go.uuid, ksuid, xid),
  **xlo** (lightweight helpers, ref `samber/lo`).
- **maxprocs** — GOMAXPROCS auto-tuner.
- **breaker** — circuit breaker.
- **limiter** — rate limiter.
- **latency** — sliding-window p50/p99/p999 histogram + client `LatencyObserver`.
- **httpclient** — HTTP client.
- **tcpclient**, **udpclient**, **grpcclient** — network clients (HTTP/2) +
  stress harness (`grpcclient` is its own sub-module).

#### Sub-modules

- **log4go** — high-performance async structured logger for ad-tech scale:
  console/file/kafka/net/io writers, structured fields (`With`/`WithField`/
  `WithFields`), JSON format (`FormatJSON`), sampling, context binding
  (zerolog-style), request-id middleware, generic overflow
  (ring→file→drop), crash resume, metrics + webhook alerts, multi-core
  ShardLogger, switchable JSON codec (goccy/std/sonic), ~1M qps/core (no-caller).
  See `log4go/PERFORMANCE.md`.
- **postgres** — pgx pool wrapper (pure Go, cross-platform).
- **kafka** — library-swappable producer + consumer wrapper (sync/async, group,
  partition; `sarama` backend at v0.1.0) with `BufferedBytes`/`Snapshot`
  monitoring.

### Infrastructure

- Modernized CI: Go version read from `go.mod`, `go vet` + `gofmt` + `test -race`;
  `golangci-lint` installed via the official script; CI actions bumped to latest
  majors (checkout@v7, setup-go@v6, codecov@v7).
- **log4go** split into an independent module; **postgres** and **grpcclient**
  likewise isolated so importing one does not pull the others' dependencies.
- Verified benchmarks recorded in `BENCHMARKS.md` and `log4go/PERFORMANCE.md`
  §21.

### Fixed

- **log4go**: caller resolution now walks past internal frames (cross-arch
  safe); `NetWriter`/`KafKaWriter` `Stop` made race-free via `CompareAndSwap`.
